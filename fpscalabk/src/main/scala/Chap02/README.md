## Chapter 2

## Main focus
* Functional core, shell of effects.
* Pushing out dealing withs effects until the last moment.
* Higher Order Function (HOF): passing function into.
* Monomorphic vs Polymorphic functions. 
> "observe polymorphic functions by observing that several monomorphic functions all share a similar structure"
* Type parameters [A,B,C] and intro type variable
* Partial application: applying a function to some, but not all of its arguments.
* Partially Applying functions
* Currying / uncurrying
